# rbx-diesound
A script to copy the old death sound to Roblox after updating.

Hate the new Roblox death sound? Running Roblox on Linux under Wine? Congratulations, this small script will copy Roblox's old death sound to the current Roblox version's sounds directory after updating, for those of you too lazy to do it yourself (aka me)

For this script to work, you must set the Roblox installation directory and the location of ouch.ogg, as they are set to work with my locations.
